node-parcheesi
==============

We're building a [Parcheesi game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parcheesi) using nodeJS, and Web Sockets. 

The project is being built using TDD. Check out the failing tests and the issue section if you want to collaborate!

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the zip file into a new folder
2. Perform `npm install` in order to install all package dependencies
3. If you haven't installed mocha globally go ahead and also do `npm install mocha -g`. This is needed to make use of the mocha CLI

* And the [mocha documentation](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/)
